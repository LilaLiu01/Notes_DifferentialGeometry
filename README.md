## **Background**：
The main reference textbook is Chen Weihuan's Differential Geometry. The notes also refer to some of do Carmo's classic textbook, as well as Wikipedia.

## **Application**：
Data scientists face challenges when building deep learning models that can be addressed by differential geometry. Those challenges are:
1. High dimensionality: Models related to computer vision or images deal with high-dimensional data, such as images or videos, which can make training more difficult due to the curse of dimensionality.
2. Embedding physics law or geometric constraints: Incorporating domain constraints such as boundary conditions or differential equations model s very challenging for high-dimensional data.
3. Representation dependence: The performance of many learning algorithms is very sensitive to the choice of representation (i.e. z-normalization impact on predictors).
